The most commonly used material is a proprietary cement-based composite containing Portland cement, supplementary cementitious materials, fine aggregates, and chemical admixtures. Critical properties include thixotropy—the ability to flow under pressure but maintain shape after extrusion—and controlled setting time to ensure proper layer adhesion. Modern formulations typically achieve compressive strengths ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 PSI.",
