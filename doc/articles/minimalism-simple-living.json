    "summary": "Minimalism is experiencing a significant comeback in 2026 as a response to cultural exhaustion. The new iteration is warmer and more intentional than the stark aesthetic of the early 2010s. A 2025 Deloitte survey found 78% of consumers say sustainability influences buying choices. Minimalists have 22-23% smaller carbon footprints than average. Practical strategies include digital decluttering, capsule wardrobes, the one-in-one-out rule, and cultivating mindful consumption.",

            "en": "Minimalism is experiencing a significant comeback in 2026, though with a notably different character than previous iterations. After 2025's emphasis on maximalism and experimentation, 2026 marks a quiet cultural shift where simplicity is reasserting itself as a response to cultural exhaustion rather than purely aesthetic preference. People are drawn to minimalism to address digital and visual overload in an overstimulated world where more feels like less.",

Rather than austere deprivation, it is characterised by intentional minimalism that is deeply reflective of personal style and well-being. This approach balances simplicity with sophistication, focusing on what truly matters rather than rigid austerity. The trend reflects practical benefits too: a 2025 Deloitte survey found that 78% of consumers say sustainability influences buying choices.",

Reducing screen time, unsubscribing from unnecessary newsletters, and organising digital files can free mental space as effectively as clearing physical clutter.

These questions help break the cycle of impulse buying that feeds both clutter and environmental strain.",
