Science fiction writer Ted Chiang argued in The New Yorker that AI \"isn't going to make art,\" claiming that art requires making numerous intentional choices. He contends that while photographers make sufficient decisions to be artists, AI users never will, and that generative AI lacks thought and intention.",
