Remote-first contracts, better cross-border tax tools, and a global map of coworking hubs make it easier than ever to swap rush-hour traffic for airport gates. At the same time, more companies are tightening remote policies or pushing hybrid models, so the freedom to work from anywhere is no longer guaranteed but must be designed deliberately.",
