Researchers have implanted CRISPR-edited pancreas cells into a person with type 1 diabetes, with cells producing insulin for months without immune-suppressing drugs. Regulatory approvals for sickle cell and beta thalassemia treatments mark another milestone in this revolutionary technology.",

The cells pumped out sugar-regulating insulin for months without the need for the recipient to take immune-dampening drugs, thanks to gene edits that allowed the cells, collected from a deceased donor, to evade detection by the recipient's immune system. This breakthrough represents a pivotal moment in the history of regenerative medicine.",

Traditionally, transplanting cells from donors requires recipients to take immunosuppressive drugs for life, which carry serious side effects including increased infection risk and organ toxicity. The gene edits create an invisibility cloak that allows donated cells to survive in the recipient's body without triggering an immune attack. Researchers used CRISPR to modify genes responsible for immune recognition, effectively making the cells invisible to the body's defense system.",
