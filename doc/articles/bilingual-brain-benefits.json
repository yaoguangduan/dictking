    "summary": "Bilingual children demonstrate enhanced executive functions, better problem-solving skills, and greater mental flexibility. Neuroimaging studies show that early second language acquisition correlates with structural brain differences and improved neural efficiency. The bilingual brain shows higher global efficiency and more streamlined processing during cognitive tasks.",
