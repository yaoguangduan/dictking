    "summary": "The Mediterranean diet, emphasising olive oil, vegetables, fruits and whole grains, is linked to longer life and reduced cancer risk. A large 2024 study found women who closely followed the diet had up to 23% lower risk of dying, with benefits partly explained by improvements in heart-related biomarkers. A 2025 study suggests the diet reduces obesity-related cancer risk through mechanisms beyond weight loss, including reduced inflammation and improved metabolic health.",
